This module aims to provide solution to create, manage, vote and see results of Polls in Chat Log during games played via Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

## Usage

This module lets you create and manage Polls using [Chat Command](#through-chat-command), [Create Poll Dialog](#through-create-dialog-ui) and [Saved Polls App](#saved-polls).

Module also supports [Chat Commander's](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/_chatcommands) autocompletion and tooltips.

### Through Chat Command
To create a poll, use `/poll` chat command. 
* First line becomes the question.
* Every other line becomes an answer. 
* Empty lines are ignored

_Tip_: Use `Shift+Enter` to go to new line when writing a message


#### Optional flags

Chat Command supports the following optional flags. Flags allow overriding the default [Configuration Settings](#configuration)

##### Mode
Use this flag by typing `--mode` or `--m` directly followed by one of allowed modes:
* `multiple` (also `multi`, `m`) — set Poll to multiple vote poll, allowing players to vote on multiple options
* `single` (also `s`) — set Poll to single vote poll, allowing players to only pick one option

##### Results
Use this flag by typing `--results` or `--r` directly followed by one of allowed settings:
* `true` (also `t`) — set Poll to allow players checking the Poll's results
* `false` (also `f`) — set Poll to hide results from players

##### Secret
Use this flag by typing `--secret` or `--s` directly followed by one of allowed settings:
* `true` (also `t`) — set Poll to hide voters
* `false` (also `f`) — set Poll to allow players seeing who voted for what options (requires players to also see results)

#### Example:
```
/p --mode single Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything
Stupid answer
Dumb answer
Just answer
Barely answer
42
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

### Through Create Dialog UI

Press `P` (keybinding is editable through Foundry's `Configure Options`) to open a "Create Poll" Dialog, where you can set Poll's Question and Options in visual form.

In this Dialog you can also set all flags as you wish.

### Saved Polls

When using "Creat Poll" Dialog, you have an option to "Create and Save". Using this button will save the Poll for your later use.

Press `Shift+P` (keybinding is editable through Foundry's `Configure Options`) to open a "Saved Polls" App, where you can see all your Saved Polls and quickly post them to Chat, delete them, or edit them.
